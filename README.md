# Perspective Playground with Vue

This small project will help you to understand vue directives, binding classes, styles, computed properties and v-model modifiers

## Project Setup

Just download the repository and open the `index.html` file on your browser.

You do not need to install Vue, the `index.html` already have a `<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>` tag that already have it to use (just for dev purposes) see here: [Install Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start#using-vue-from-cdn)
